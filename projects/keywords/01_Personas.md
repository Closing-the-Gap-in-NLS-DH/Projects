## Professional Use

### Persona I (50)
Senior Researcher
Description: Persona I is a senior researcher heading a research project on a topic related to the premodern Arabic literary tradition. As a part of daily work, they rely heavily on the use of the field-related terminology and need a reliable source of information and definitions that can be quoted, cited and/or used in teaching or when dealing with non-specialist contacts.

### Persona II (30)
Doctoral Student
Persona II is a doctoral student, who is writing a dissertation about a topic closely related to the premodern Arabic literary tradition. As such, they really value encyclopedic works for a proper citation of descriptions and definitions of terms and keywords that are part of their doctoral research. Also, Persona II wishes to publish short articles that are peer-reviewed but easier to publish and knows that some terms have yet to be described.

### Persona III (22)
Student Assistant
Description: Persona III is an Arabic-speaking student assistant of comparative literature, who works at a project with a focus on the premodern Arabic literary tradition. As their own studies do not focus on the topic and their language knowledge is more weighed towards practical skills, they need a platform to search for some of the terms they encounter while working for the project. Persona III also sees the platform as a way to publish their first publication in form of a short article about a topic yet unavailable in the encyclopedia.

## Lay professionals

### Persona V (33)
Children's book author and artist
Description: Persona V wants to write a children's book about two children from different cultural backgrounds. They have some Muslim friends but no specific knowledge in Arabic literature, especially not in the proper terminology. As they want to be as on point as possible, they look for a service that offers lowlevel access to scientifically grounded explanations with cross-references to other relevant side topics.

### Persona VI (42)
Journalist
Description: Persona VI is a journalist at a well-known newspaper that is known for its well-researched articles. Recently, they changed the resort and now is writing for cultural connections to the Arab world and local Arab culture. However, Persona VI did never have any connection to Arabic specifically, but was primarily chosen for this resort as for their professional style, experience in cross-cultural topics and calm attitude towards the topics they write on. That is why they need a platform to research terms that are not familiar or needed to be explained.

### Persona VII (55)
Police
Description: In their daily work, Persona VII has a lot of contact with people of Arab origin as they work "in the field". Most of what is talked about is well known to Persona VII as they learned overtime and the people they talk to are often second or third generation and thus more proficient in German than in Arabic. However, sometimes it happens that Persona VII stumbles over terms they read or hear that they do not know. For being able to classify these terms, they need a service with a reliable explanation and some context information.

### Persona VIII (35)
Administration
Description: Persona VIII speaks Arabic with their parents but is proficient in cultural or literary terminologies. In their Job, Persona VIII works a lot with people of Arab origin and Arabic writings, which mostly works well due to the spoken Arabic matching their skills, but sometimes they have to deal with more complex language and thus lack the specific vocabulary. Also, Persona VIII wishes to show some articles about terms to their Arabic-speaking parents, who were once interested in literature but far from being professionals, thus they need a platform that presents articles about specific terms, both for Persona VIII's work, as well as for them to show their parents.

## Interested Public

### Persona IV (63)
Description: Persona IV is an interested person, who used to study philology back in the days and happened to get in contact with premodern Arabic literature. They read some works on the topic but lack some of the necessary terms and so they use a search engine to find a webpage that offers an encyclopedia of important keywords. While having some skills in Arabic, they are far from professional in the necessary field.

### Persona IX (55)
Description: Persona IX is a trainer of a sports team and sometimes lacks the vocabulary to understand, what their players are talking about. They are nevertheless interested in remaining connected to them in terms of conversation topics and thus seek to inform themselves about some of the words they encountered. As they have heard that in the internet is full of fake information, they would like to have a reliable, scholarly backed source that remains easy to understand.
