## Description
The written Arabic heritage is as vast as it is understudied and underrepresented in the digital humanities. The sheer volume and diversity of the surviving works produced in Arabic in the premodern period makes this body of texts ideal for computational forms of analysis. Efforts to utilize these new digital forms of analysis, however, have been stymied by the lack of a reliable corpus. Started as **OpenArabic**, an effort within the Alexander von Humboldt Chair for Digital Humanities (Leipzig University) to create the first machine-actionable scholarly corpus of premodern Arabic texts, **OpenITI** is the next stage of development of the corpus of not only Arabic texts, but also texts in other languages of the Islamic world.

### Description
The main goal of OpenITI mARkdown is to provide a simple system for tagging structural, morphological and semantic elements in premodern and early modern Islamicate texts of the OpenITI corpus. The use of OpenITI mARkdown will allow one to engage in the computational analysis of texts in the same way as allowed by the more complex and time-consuming tagging schemes such as TEI XML; OpenITI mARkdown will also facilitate the conversion of the large volume of Islamicate texts into TEI XML, which is now the standard format for digital editions. In principle, OpenITI mARkdown does not require any special editor, but the current implementation relies on EditPad Pro, which supports right-to-left languages, Unicode, and large files. However, it is the support of custom highlighting and navigation schemes that makes this text editor particularly convenient for OpenITI mARkdown.

OpenITI mARkdown is not meant to be a comprehensive standard, but rather a light-weight tagging scheme that renders texts machine readable and can be adapted to specific research tasks. The scheme consists of a set of unified patterns, but also includes custom patterns that facilitate analysis of specific types of data. These patterns can be divided into structural (unified), morphological (unified, customizable) and semantic (unified customizable, but also custom). The scheme currently accommodates a variety of research inquiries.
