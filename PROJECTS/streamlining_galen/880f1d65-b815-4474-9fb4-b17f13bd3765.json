The focus of the research lies on the Arabic summaries of Galen which served as primary learning tools for medical students and doctors. The main output of the project will be a comprehensive survey of Arabic Galenic summaries and a digital corpus of selected texts. Project members will analyze and compare them with each other and with the Galen treatises in Arabic translation that formed the basis of the summaries.",
