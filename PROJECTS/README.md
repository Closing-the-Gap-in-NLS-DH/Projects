# Closing the Gap in Non-Latin Script Data

The project aims to facilitate research in Digital Humanities projects dealing with Non-Latin Script in Latin Script environments. One of our goals is to gather and provide information on existing projects. As a first step, this repository is meant to contain basic information on research or infrastructure projects, initiatives and/or related institutions in a structured way.
