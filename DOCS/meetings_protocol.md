# Protocol of CtG Team Meetings

## 2023-09-08

Time: 10:00–11:30 (Berlin)
Participants (alphabetical): Theodore Beers, Beatrice Gründler, Xenia Kudela, Jonas Müller-Laackman

- Documentation

  - Documentation of our technology and workflow should be systematized. A new `DOCS` folder containing the changelog, list of dependencies, and description of our workflow will be added to the GitHub repo. (Xenia and Theo)
  - Releases: The latest GitHub release is outdated. New releases should be launched—one today and another after the new taxonomy has been implemented. For better searchability, the new release should contain three folders: `SCHEMA`, `DATA`, and one for the entire project (?). If possible, the release should be also connected to Zenodo. (Jonas)
  - The schema version should be bumped after the taxonomy has been changed. (Xenia)

- Questionnaire

  - A draft of the interview questionnaire has been prepared by Theo. The questionnaire should contain the most crucial questions to be asked of all projects. But each interview will also have its own particular points to cover. This topic is scheduled to be discussed in depth at the next meeting. (Everyone)

- Meeting in Hamburg

  - The event will take place in the first few months of 2024.
  - Guests should be asked in advance for preferred times. (Jonas?)
  - A small workshop should be offered alongside the presentation of the project. Idea: giving an overview of our data and proposing possible implementations based on this research. (Jonas, Theo, Xenia)

- Website

  - The search pane should be updated to enable filtering projects by marking multiple tags at once. (Xenia, Theo)
  - New cards with detailed information about each project (e.g., research and output languages) should be implemented soon. (Theo)
  - For now, the languages listed in the existing cards will not be changed.

- Taxonomy

  - The new keywords are ready; they will be visible on the website within a week. (Xenia)
  - The display categories for the keywords should be as follows: discipline, topic, output, resources, and methods. (Xenia)
  - The proposed division between primary disciplines, which fall within the focus of the project (e.g., Arabic or Persian Studies), and secondary disciplines (e.g., Literary Studies or Linguistics), was questioned by team members due to its hierarchical and exclusive tone. We may return to this question later.

- Interviews

  - The first interviews should take place ASAP, i.e., as soon as the questionnaire is ready. A list of the first few proposed interviewees has been set by the team privately.
  - If possible, the first interviews should take place directly after team meetings, so that everyone can sit in. Once the pace of interviews increases, other time slots will be found.

- Next meeting

  - Date and time: 2023-09-29, 10:00–11:30 (Berlin)
  - Topics: Questionnaire and other updates
  - Xenia and Theo will meet separately before this to discuss the questionnaire.
